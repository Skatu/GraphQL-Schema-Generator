The goal of this project is to automatically generate GraphQL schemas based on the classes in the projects.

This is still in a very early state, and a lot of things still need to be done, like:
1) how to properly recognize ID fields
2) handle nested classes
3) handle java lists and other structures
4) how to recognize non-null fields
5) Recognize other Java data types, like AtomicInteger, BigDecimal, etc.

This is a small list but I'm sure there are more cases that will appear as the project advances. This is still just a prototype.
